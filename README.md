## Generated Docs

Using doxygen to generate docs is simple and it does a nice job but
so far I'm unable to justify the time required to make it into a 
nice package.

Doxygen uses the README.md files to generate list of READMEs on the 
main page but they're not organized into a hierarchy.  While this doesn't
precluse the use of READMEs it certainly makes organization a pain.

Additionally the doxygen output is huge (>80MB) for the entire libs
hierarchy...

Revisit.
